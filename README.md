# Applied-Deep-Learning
These three projects were undertaken as part of the course “Applied Deep Learning” with the aim of providing insights into the field of Deep Learning and its diverse methodologies.

## Practical_Assignment1
This assignment aims to create a CNN model form scratch with the goal of evaluating two different datasets. These datasets are CIFAR10 and EuroSAT. To achieve this goal, a CNN model with different layers was developed, incorporating adjustment to hyperparameters and the implementation of Data Augmentation.

## Practical_Assignment2
The goal of this second assignment is to study Transfer Learning techniques in Deep Learning that are capable of detecting objects. This assignment is divided into two parts: the first part consists of detecting objects using two pre-defined CNN models, ResNET18 and MobileNetV2, and the second part consists of detecting objects using YOLOV3 network. The KITTI dataset is used for both steps.

## Practical_Assignment3
The aim of this assignment is to study Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) techniques for controlling an agent in a simulated environment. This environment consists of a car racing along a track, operated in either discrete or continuous mode. To analyze the car behavior under various conditions, including different colors of the environment, tracks, and operation modes, is used DeepRL techniques such as DQN, Double DQN, and Dueling DQN.
